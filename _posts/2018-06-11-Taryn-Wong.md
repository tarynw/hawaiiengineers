When I was younger, I thought engineers just solved super difficult math and science problems all day. I couldn't have been more wrong! Engineers create and innovate. While engineering does involve logic-based thinking and solving problems, it also encourages you to be creative. Since technology and its world applications are always evolving, engineering allows you the freedom to continually discover new ideas and make new things. Plus, engineering encapsulates so many different fields of study. Some people study one type of engineering, don't find it interesting, and think that all engineering will be the same. If you explore further - whether you want to work in a business office, a research lab, outdoors, or even in outer space - you will likely find a field for you!
